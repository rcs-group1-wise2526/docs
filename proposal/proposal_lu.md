## **Proposal: Personality Fingerprinting of Persona-Prompted Large Language Models(draft)**

### *Extending Construct Analysis to the Big Five Personality Inventory (BIG5)*

### **1. Background and Motivation**

Prof. Simon Münker (...) paper 1. 

In a related line of work, Münker (2025) examined persona-based prompting in the context of political ideology, using the Moral Foundations Questionnaire (MFQ) to evaluate whether model personas (e.g., “liberal” vs. “conservative”) produce response distributions consistent with those of corresponding human participants.

This project proposes to **synthesize both methodologies** and apply them to a widely, domain-general personality framework: the **Big Five Inventory (BIG5)**.
By integrating both methodologies, we aim to evaluate whether LLMs can reproduce human-like personality structures when conditioned with different personality descriptors(prompt).

### **2. Research Questions**

We address the following research questions:

**RQ1:** To what extent do fingerprints generated by persona-prompted LLMs align with the fingerprint structures observed in human subgroups characterized by distinct personality types?

**RQ2:** How does persona-based prompting (e.g., “You are a Extraversion person”) affect the fingerprint structures of LLM responses?

### **3. Methodology**

#### **3.1 Instrument**

We employ the **Big Five Inventory (BIG5)**, a self-report scale measuring five core personality dimensions:
*Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness,* and *Neuroticism*.
Each item is rated on a five-point scale where 1=Disagree, 3=Neutral, 5=Agree.

#### **3.2 LLM Sampling**

We will survey several open-weight models under two conditions:

1. **Neutral condition:** baseline model responses with no persona instruction(TBD).
2. **Persona condition:** contextually prompted with synthetic self-descriptions such as

   * “You are an Extraversion person.”
   * “You are an Neuroticism person.”

Each model-persona will generate **1,000(TBD)** samples(Each sample corresponds to a complete response to all items of the BIG5).

#### **3.3 Fingerprint Construction**

For each model and persona, we compute the **psychological fingerprint**.


#### **3.4 Human Baseline**

We will use publicly available **human datasets** as baseline (e.g., [OpenPsychometrics.org](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tunguz/big-five-personality-test/data)) to generate reference fingerprints for various personality subgroups.

#### **3.5 Cross-Comparison**

Each fingerprint compared using **cosine similarity**. This quantifies structural similarity between LLM and human fingerprints.

We will also use further comparison methods like those in paper1.

### **4. Expected Contributions**

1. **Methodological Integration:** Combine fingerprinting with persona prompting in a unified framework.
2. **Construct Representation Analysis:** Provide the systematic evaluation of how LLMs represent **personality constructs**, not just humor or morality.
3. **Persona Influence Assessment:** Quantify how self-assigned personas prompt alter the fingerprint structure.
4. **Cross-Human Alignment Metrics:** Compare the fingerprint structures of human subgroups and LLMs to evaluate the degree of alignment in psychological construct representation.
